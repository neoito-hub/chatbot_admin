Blocks are listed with all the necessary details. To make finding\nblocks easier,\n\n * Search - You can search for different blocks that cater to your needs by entering keywords in the search bar, as shown in the\n   above picture.\n * Filter - You can filter the registry for blocks by the following conditions: Appblocks version, Language/Frameworks, Block\n   Type, Visibility, Depedencies, Category\n\n\nVISITING AND USING A BLOCK\n\nWhen you click any Block in the registry, you are redirected to the Block Details page. It gives you all details about the\nparticular block. There will be ReadMe, Versions, Block Dependencies, Composable Blocks and Variants. On the right side, you can\nsee installation instructions. Copy and paste the bb-cli command in the CLI and use the block right away. You can also find the\nnumber of downloads, tags, version and other such useful information about the Block.\n\nimage [https://github.com/appblocks-hub/docs/assets/33730398/566aa853-8cf3-4e65-9874-aaf3c976e5ec]\n\nREADME\n\nThe ReadMe tab contains general information about this particular block.

While using appblocks, we always recommend\ncreating and reusing blocks which are battle-tested components. For running tests, we have the bb run-test command in bb-cli. It\nsearches for all the files with .test.js or .spec.js extension or in the ___tests___ folder inside each qualifying block inside\nthe root package block and runs the tests. Use the bb run-test --help flag for more documentation on the command.\n\n\nTESTING SETUP\n\nThe blocks come bundled with Jest and the test script. Jest [https://jestjs.io/] is a JavaScript test runner that provides\nresources for writing and running tests. The UI blocks come with React Testing Library included. React Testing Library\n[https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/] offers a set of testing helpers that structure your tests based on\nuser interactions rather than components’ implementation details. Jest is used as the test runner, and React Testing Library\nprovides test helpers for structuring tests around user interactions.\n\nThe test setup can be configured to desired preference by use of config files. It is advised to install all the packages before\nrunning the tests.\n\n\nADDING THE TESTS\n\n\nUNIT TESTS\n\nUnit testing is a way to test small pieces of code. The unit under test (UUT) is usually an individual function or method in your\napplication\n\n * If Jest is not configured in a block. Install Jest using the command.\n   \n     npm i -D jest\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\n * Add the following section to your package.json:\n   \n     {\n         \"scripts\": {\n         \"test\": \"jest\"\n         }\n     }\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\n * Create files containg testing logic with .test.js or .spec.js extension along with the files you need to test or include them\n   in the ___tests___ folder. For e.g. /App.test.js\n   \n   import React from 'react'\n   import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'\n   import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'\n   import App from './src/App'\n   \n   describe('App', () => {\n     it('renders without crashing', async () => {\n       render(\n         <BrowserRouter>\n           <App />\n         </BrowserRouter>\n       )\n       const appElement = screen.getByTestId('app')\n       await waitFor(() => expect(appElement).toBeInTheDocument())\n     })\n   })\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\n * Run the following command in bb-bli\n   \n     bb run-test\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\nEdit this page [https://github.com/appblocks-hub/docs/tree/main/docs/testing.mdx]\n\nPrevious\nSpaces\n[/docs/Platform Features/Spaces]\n\n * Introduction\n * Testing Setup\n * Adding the tests\n   * Unit Tests","metadata":{"source":"https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/testing","title":"Testing | Appblocks Developer Docs","description":"Introduction","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"{\"payload\":{\"allShortcutsEnabled\":false,\"fileTree\":{\"docs\":{\"items\":[{\"name\":\"CLI\",\"path\":\"docs/CLI\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"Platform\nFeatures\",\"path\":\"docs/Platform\nFeatures\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"SDK\",\"path\":\"docs/SDK\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"core-concepts\",\"path\":\"docs/core-concepts\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"quickstart\",\"path\":\"docs/quickstart\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"intro.mdx\",\"path\":\"docs/intro.mdx\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"testing.mdx\",\"path\":\"docs/testing.mdx\",\"contentType\":\"file\"}],\"totalCount\":7},\"\":{\"items\":[{\"name\":\".docusaurus\",\"path\":\".docusaurus\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"docs\",\"path\":\"docs\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"src\",\"path\":\"src\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"static\",\"path\":\"static\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\".DS_Store\",\"path\":\".DS_Store\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\".gitignore\",\"path\":\".gitignore\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"LICENSE\",\"path\":\"LICENSE\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"README.md\",\"path\":\"README.md\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"amplify.yml\",\"path\":\"amplify.yml\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"babel.config.js\",\"path\":\"babel.config.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"docusaurus.config.js\",\"path\":\"docusaurus.config.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"package-lock.json\",\"path\":\"package-lock.json\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"package.json\",\"path\":\"package.json\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"sidebars.js\",\"path\":\"sidebars.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"tailwind.config.js\",\"path\":\"tailwind.config.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"yarn.lock\",\"path\":\"yarn.lock\",\"contentType\":\"file\"}],\"totalCount\":16}},\"fileTreeProcessingTime\":8.809703,\"foldersToFetch\":[],\"repo\":{\"id\":498218883,\"defaultBranch\":\"main\",\"name\":\"docs\",\"ownerLogin\":\"appblocks-hub\",\"currentUserCanPush\":false,\"isFork\":false,\"isEmpty\":false,\"createdAt\":\"2022-05-31T06:47:36.000Z\",\"ownerAvatar\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109507147?v=4\",\"public\":true,\"private\":false,\"isOrgOwned\":true},\"symbolsExpanded\":false,\"treeExpanded\":true,\"refInfo\":{\"name\":\"main\",\"listCacheKey\":\"v0:1700737185.0\",\"canEdit\":false,\"refType\":\"branch\",\"currentOid\":\"0ca958cfba5e361ef21ef6095dbf1e8d0d9c448b\"},\"path\":\"docs/intro.mdx\",\"currentUser\":null,\"blob\":{\"rawLines\":[\"---\",\"title:\nWhy Appblocks?\",\"sidebar_position: 1\",\"sidebar_class_name: \\\"side-menu-why-appblocks\\\"\",\"---\",\"\",\"## Motivation\",\"\",\"“Not all Apps\nrequire re-engineering.

A block is the basic unit of an\napp that solves a business use case.\n\nFrom a developer's perspective, a block encases any specific functionality. Building a block or reusing it is as easy as writing\nan ordinary function.\n\nEach block has a type for the kind of functionality it performs. The block types are UI Blocks (UI-Element Blocks and UI-Container\nBlocks), Function Blocks, Shared Blocks and Package Blocks.\n\nTYPES OF BLOCKS\n\n\nBLOCKS COME IN\nALL SHAPES AND SIZES\n\nThere’s always a block to play around with. Code away in an opinionated architecture, block by block, and improve the\nfunctionality of your app with ease.\n\nCheck Docs [https://docs.appblocks.com/]\n[../../assets/images/icons/blocks-shape.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/ui-block.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/block-cube.svg]\n\n\nUI BLOCK\n\nUI Block is a frontend Block developed for browser runtimes. It includes UI Elements, which are reusable UI components, and\nContainer Blocks, which orchestrate the elements and handle routing and layout. UI Blocks are React-based and follow Webpack\nModule Federation. Container Blocks pull and render remote element Blocks, combining bundles from remote servers at runtime to\nrender the app.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-1.svg] [../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-2.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-3.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/fn-block.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/block-cube.svg]\n\n\nFUNCTION BLOCK\n\nFn Blocks are the backend API Blocks. Each of these blocks is supposed to be mutually exclusive.\nEvery Fn Block will have a specific URL to invoke it and in practical scenarios, all the Fn Blocks in an app will be stitched\ntogether and run in a single instance on the server.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-1.svg] [../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-2.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-3.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/shared-block.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/block-cube.svg]\n\n\nSHARED BLOCK\n\nIn both frontend and backend, there can be some pieces of code that may be shared which are most probably for utility methods or\nfor data models. Eg, function to find the age of a person from dob/ date filter and so on. These blocks are called Shared Blocks.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-1.svg] [../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-2.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-3.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/package-block.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/block-cube.svg]\n\n\nPACKAGE BLOCK\n\nWhen multiple blocks are combined together into a unit, such an arrangement is called a Package Block. UI, Fn, and shared Blocks\nhave their own repositories. They are the building blocks of an application. Once all the Blocks are stitched together, we build a\nconfiguration that is a snapshot of how the apps are composed.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-1.svg] [../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-2.svg]\n[../../assets/images/icons/tech-icon-3.svg]\n\nWHY APPBLOCKS?\n\n\nCOMPOSABLE ENTERPRISE VIA COMPOSABLE SOFTWARE\n\nUsing interchangeable building blocks to create, innovate and adapt business operations,\nenabling us to respond to external or internal factors.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/faster-icon.svg]\n\nFASTER\n\nNo need to write the\nsame component twice.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/code-icon.svg]\n\nCONSISTENT\n\nComponent will look\nand feel the same.\n\n[../../assets/images/icons/scalable-icon.svg]\n\nSCALABLE\n\nMany teams can\nbuild and work together.\n\nBUILD .

Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and\n     our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that by clicking “Join Now”, “Join LinkedIn”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services\n     (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using our\n     Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not click “Join\n     Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this contract, at any time\n     you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.\n     \n     SERVICES\n     \n     This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps,\n     communications and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite\n     collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.\n     Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”.\n     \n     LINKEDIN\n     \n     You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).\n     \n     We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and\n     Switzerland.\n     \n     If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company\n     (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for,\n     or processed in connection with our Services.\n     \n     If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn\n     Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in\n     connection with our Services.\n     \n     \n     \n     This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy\n     Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (which includes our Cookie Policy\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy] and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and updates.\n     \n     \n     1.2 MEMBERS AND VISITORS\n     \n     When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register for our Services,\n     you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”\n     \n     \n     1.3 CHANGE\n     \n     \n     \n     We may make changes to the Contract.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to it,\n     we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes\n     before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may close your\n     account [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]. Your\n     continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are\n     consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.\n\n\n 2.  2. OBLIGATIONS\n     \n     \n     2.1 SERVICE ELIGIBILITY\n     \n     \n     \n     Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.\n     \n     To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\"(described below) or older; (2) you will only have one\n     LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the\n     Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of\n     others or persons under the age of 16.\n     \n     “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide\n     the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.\n     \n     \n     2.2 YOUR ACCOUNT\n     \n     \n     \n     You will keep your password a secret\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and keep it confidential; (2) not transfer any part of\n     your account (e.g., connections) and (3) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and Professional Community Policies\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]. You are\n     responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.\n     \n     As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by\n     another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right\n     to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal\n     account\n     \n     \n     2.3 PAYMENT\n     \n     \n     \n     You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there\n     may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Refunds are subject to our policy.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     If you buy any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional\n     terms [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/terms-for-paid-services] specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees\n     will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:\n     \n      * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).\n      * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions\n        in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.\n      * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period\n        for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how\n        to cancel or suspend\n        [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] your Premium\n        Services.\n      * All of your purchases of Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy\n        [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5704?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en].\n      * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.\n     \n     You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “Purchase History\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/mnyfe/secure/purchasehistoryv4]”.\n     \n     \n     2.4 NOTICES AND MESSAGES\n     \n     \n     \n     You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your\n     contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the\n     contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact\n     information [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34987?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] up to\n     date.\n     \n     Please review your settings to control and limit\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] messages you receive\n     from us.\n     \n     \n     2.5 SHARING\n     \n     \n     \n     When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, articles, group posts, links to\n     news articles, job postings, messages and InMails. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other\n     Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices\n     you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn\n     connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile\n     update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So, if you apply\n     for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job\n     poster.\n     \n     We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it with or without notice.\n     \n     Key terms\n     \n     MINIMUM AGE\n     \n     Members who were below this new Minimum Age when they started using the Services under a previous User Agreement which had\n     allowed certain persons under 16 to use the Services, may continue to use the Services. As of June 2017 persons under the age\n     of 16 are not eligible to use our Services.\n\n\n 3.  3. RIGHTS AND LIMITS\n     \n     \n     3.1. YOUR LICENSE TO LINKEDIN\n     \n     \n     \n     You own all of the content, feedback and personal information you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive\n     license to it.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your information and content, including how it can be used for ads.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     As between you and LinkedIn, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services, and you are only\n     granting LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license:\n     \n     A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process, information and\n     content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further consent, notice and/or\n     compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:\n     \n      1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your\n         account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied, re-shared it or\n         stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.\n      2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your\n         separate consent (including sponsored content). However, we have the right, without payment to you or others, to serve\n         ads near your content and information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the\n         Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within\n         our Services, subject to your settings.\n      3. We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your content beyond the Services. However, if you\n         choose to share your post as \"public, everyone or similar\", we will enable a feature that allows other Members to embed\n         that public post onto third-party services, and we enable search engines to make that public content findable though\n         their services. Learn More\n         [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/86529?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]\n      4.

Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it\n         available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license [https://creativecommons.org/choose/].\n     \n     \n     \n     You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process and use any information and personal data that you provide in\n     accordance with, the terms of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] and your choices (including\n     settings).\n     \n     By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share\n     (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.\n     \n     \n     \n     You promise to only provide information and content that you have the right to share, and that your LinkedIn profile will be\n     truthful.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone’s rights (including intellectual\n     property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove\n     certain information or content in certain countries.\n     \n     \n     3.2 SERVICE AVAILABILITY\n     \n     \n     \n     We may change or end any Service or modify our prices prospectively.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services.

LinkedIn generally does not review content provided by our Members or others. You\n     agree that we are not responsible for others’ (including other Members’) content or information. We cannot always prevent\n     this misuse of our Services, and you agree that we are not responsible for any such misuse.

We understand that\n    certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer\n    unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company\n    or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).\n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], when you use workplace tools and services (e.g.,\n    interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with\n    information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.\n    \n    \n    3.2 COMMUNICATION ARCHIVAL\n    \n    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n    \n    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media\n    activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those\n    Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our\n    Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.\n    \n    \n    3.3 OTHERS’ SERVICES\n    \n    \n    \n    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such\n    platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also\n    appear on the services of others.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], other services may look up your profile. When you opt\n    to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal\n    data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your\n    Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you\n    the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and\n    you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/account] the link with such accounts.\n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing], excerpts from your profile\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] will appear on the\n    services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the\n    person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854?trk=psettings-data-sharing_api&lang=en], talent and lead managers). “Old”\n    profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.\n    \n    \n    3.4 RELATED SERVICES\n    \n    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\n    \n    We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information\n    internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to\n    you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.\n    \n    \n    3.5 SERVICE PROVIDERS\n    \n    We may use others to help us with our Services.\n    \n    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and\n    development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are\n    obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.\n    \n    \n    3.6 LEGAL DISCLOSURES\n    \n    We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or\n    others.\n    \n    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or\n    if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding\n    suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3)\n    investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our\n    Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of\n    LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when\n    appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such\n    demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not\n    promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] and Transparency\n    Report [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency].\n    \n    \n    3.7 CHANGE IN CONTROL OR SALE\n    \n    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy\n    Policy.\n    \n    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these\n    events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in\n    the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\n\n\n 5. 4. YOUR CHOICES & OBLIGATIONS\n    \n    \n    4.1 DATA RETENTION\n    \n    We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.\n    \n    We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This\n    includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use\n    our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless\n    you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a\n    depersonalized or aggregated form.\n    \n    \n    4.2 RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n    \n    You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.\n    \n    We provide many choices\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/66?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] about the collection,\n    use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit] and controlling the visibility of your posts\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/431?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] to\n    advertising opt-outs\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] and communication\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/messages] controls.

We generally delete closed account\n    information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.\n    \n    We retain your personal data even after you have closed your account if reasonably necessary to comply with our legal\n    obligations (including law enforcement requests), meet regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent\n    fraud and abuse (e.g., if we have restricted\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/82934?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] your account for\n    breach of our Professional Community Policies\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en]), enforce our User\n    Agreement, or fulfill your request to \"unsubscribe\" from further messages from us.

Groups content and ratings or review content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown\n    user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g., search engine results) until\n    they refresh their cache.\n\n\n 6. 5. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION\n    \n    \n    5.1.

This Cookie Policy applies to\nany LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies\nsuch as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as\npart of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (“Services”) and which\nincludes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with\nLinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information\nabout how and when we use these technologies. \n\nBy continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes\ndescribed in this policy.\n\n\nWHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED?\n\nENTER A SUMMARY\n\nType of technology Description Cookies\n\nA cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites\nmay receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third\nparties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521].\n\n \n\nWe use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is\nused for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our\nServices without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to\none of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the\ncurrent visit to a website or a browser session).\n\nPixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit\ninformation) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about\nyour interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us\nand third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store\ninformation locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling\nfeatures, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking\ntechnologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to\nsimilar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.\n\n\n\n\nOur cookie tables [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table] lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of\nour Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THESE TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR?\n\nBelow we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.\n\nENTER SUMMARY\n\nPurpose Description Authentication\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.\n\n \n\nIf you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line\nwith your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account.\n\n \n\nSecurity\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.\n\n \n\nFor example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious\nactivity and violations of our User Agreement.\n\n \n\nPreferences, features and services\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our\nServices more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use\nthese technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.\n\n \n\nFor example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local\nstorage to speed up site functionality.\n\n \n\nCustomized content\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.\n\n \n\nFor example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional\ninformation that relates to your previous search.\n\nPlugins on and off LinkedIn\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.\n\n \n\nFor example, our plugins, including the \"Apply with LinkedIn\" button or the \"Share\" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party\nsites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and\nrecognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking \"Apply\"), the plugin\nwill use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply.\n\n \n\nYou can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\n \n\nAdvertising\n\nCookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to\nmeasure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone\nwho was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another\nsite. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and\nhow it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.\n\n \n\nWe may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s\nor partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners.\n\n \n\nFor further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy\nPolicy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\n \n\nAs noted in Section 1.4 [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#collect] of our Privacy Policy, outside Designated\nCountries [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy], we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your\ndevice where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can\nprovide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.\n\n \n\nFor further information, please see Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\nAnalytics and research\n\nCookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.\n\n \n\nWe or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including\nas you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service\nproviders, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn\nwhether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.\n\n \n\nWe also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.\n\n \n\nIf you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with\nour Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may\nshare these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT THIRD PARTIES USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SERVICES?\n\nThird parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.\n\nFor example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for\ntheir own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit LinkedIn’s Help Center\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83251].\n\nThird parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use\ncookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to\nanalyze and research our Services.\n\n\nYOUR CHOICES\n\nYou have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to\nset cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you.\nIt may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.\n\n\nOPT OUT OF TARGETED ADVERTISING\n\nAs described in Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy], you have choices regarding the\npersonalized ads you may see.\n\nLinkedIn Members can adjust their settings here\n[https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy].\n\nVisitor controls can be found here\n[https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy].\n\nSome mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads\npersonalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile\nadvertising IDs for targeted advertising.\n\n\nBROWSER CONTROLS\n\nMost browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of\ncookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about\nbrowser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.\n\n\nWHAT IS DO NOT TRACK (DNT)?\n\nDNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet\nindustry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities\nacross websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.\n\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\nTo learn more about advertisers’ use of cookies, please visit the following links:\n\n * Internet Advertising Bureau (US) [https://www.iab.com/]\n * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU) [https://www.edaa.eu/]\n * Internet Advertising Bureau (EU) [https://iabeurope.eu/]\n\n * LinkedIn © 2024\n * About [https://about.linkedin.com?trk=content_footer-about]\n * Accessibility [https://www.linkedin.com/accessibility?trk=content_footer-accessibility]\n * User Agreement [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=content_footer-user-agreement]\n * Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy]\n * Cookie Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=content_footer-cookie-policy]\n * Copyright Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/copyright-policy?trk=content_footer-copyright-policy]\n * Brand Policy [https://brand.linkedin.com/policies?trk=content_footer-brand-policy]\n * Guest Controls [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls?trk=content_footer-guest-controls]\n * Community Guidelines [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=content_footer-community-guide]\n   \n *  * العربية (Arabic)\n    * Čeština (Czech)\n    * Dansk (Danish)\n    * Deutsch (German)\n    * English (English)\n    * Español (Spanish)\n    * Français (French)\n    * हिंदी (Hindi)\n    * Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\n    * Italiano (Italian)\n    * 日本語 (Japanese)\n    * 한국어 (Korean)\n    * Bahasa Malaysia (Malay)\n    * Nederlands (Dutch)\n    * Norsk (Norwegian)\n    * Polski (Polish)\n    * Português (Portuguese)\n    * Română (Romanian)\n    * Русский (Russian)\n    * Svenska (Swedish)\n    * ภาษาไทย (Thai)\n    * Tagalog (Tagalog)\n    * Türkçe (Turkish)\n    * Українська (Ukrainian)\n    * 简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified))\n    * 正體中文 (Chinese (Traditional))\n   \n   Language","metadata":{"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=guest_homepage-basic_google-auth-button_cookie-policy","title":"Cookie Policy | LinkedIn","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"Skip to main content\n\nAgree & Join LinkedIn\n\nBy clicking Continue, you agree to LinkedIn’s User Agreement\n[/legal/user-agreement?trk=guest_homepage-basic_google-auth-button_user-agreement], Privacy Policy\n[/legal/privacy-policy?trk=guest_homepage-basic_google-auth-button_privacy-policy], and Cookie Policy\n[/legal/cookie-policy?trk=guest_homepage-basic_google-auth-button_cookie-policy].\n\n\n\nLinkedIn [/?trk=guest_homepage-basic_nav-header-logo]\n * Articles [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topics/home/?trk=guest_homepage-basic_guest_nav_menu_articles]\n * People [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/+/+?trk=guest_homepage-basic_guest_nav_menu_people]\n * Learning [https://www.linkedin.com/learning/search?trk=guest_homepage-basic_guest_nav_menu_learning]\n * Jobs [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?trk=guest_homepage-basic_guest_nav_menu_jobs]\n\nJoin now [https://www.linkedin.com/signup?trk=guest_homepage-basic_nav-header-join] Sign in\n[https://www.linkedin.com/login?fromSignIn=true&trk=guest_homepage-basic_nav-header-signin]\n\n\nWELCOME TO YOUR PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY\n\nEmail or phone\n\n\n\n\nPassword\nShow\n\n\n\nForgot password?

INTRODUCTION\n     \n     \n     1.1 CONTRACT\n     \n     \n     \n     When you use our Services you agree to all of these terms. Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and\n     our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that by clicking “Join Now”, “Join LinkedIn”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services\n     (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using our\n     Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not click “Join\n     Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this contract, at any time\n     you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.\n     \n     SERVICES\n     \n     This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps,\n     communications and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite\n     collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.\n     Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”.\n     \n     LINKEDIN\n     \n     You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).\n     \n     We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and\n     Switzerland.\n     \n     If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company\n     (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for,\n     or processed in connection with our Services.\n     \n     If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn\n     Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in\n     connection with our Services.\n     \n     \n     \n     This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy\n     Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (which includes our Cookie Policy\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy] and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and updates.\n     \n     \n     1.2 MEMBERS AND VISITORS\n     \n     When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register for our Services,\n     you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”\n     \n     \n     1.3 CHANGE\n     \n     \n     \n     We may make changes to the Contract.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to it,\n     we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes\n     before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may close your\n     account [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]. Your\n     continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are\n     consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.\n\n\n 2.  2. OBLIGATIONS\n     \n     \n     2.1 SERVICE ELIGIBILITY\n     \n     \n     \n     Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.\n     \n     To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\"(described below) or older; (2) you will only have one\n     LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the\n     Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of\n     others or persons under the age of 16.\n     \n     “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide\n     the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.\n     \n     \n     2.2 YOUR ACCOUNT\n     \n     \n     \n     You will keep your password a secret\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and keep it confidential; (2) not transfer any part of\n     your account (e.g., connections) and (3) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and Professional Community Policies\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en].

INTRODUCTION\n     \n     \n     1.1 CONTRACT\n     \n     \n     \n     When you use our Services you agree to all of these terms. Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and\n     our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that by clicking “Join Now”, “Join LinkedIn”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services\n     (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using our\n     Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not click “Join\n     Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this contract, at any time\n     you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.\n     \n     SERVICES\n     \n     This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps,\n     communications and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite\n     collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.\n     Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”.\n     \n     LINKEDIN\n     \n     You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).\n     \n     We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and\n     Switzerland.\n     \n     If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company\n     (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for,\n     or processed in connection with our Services.\n     \n     If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn\n     Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in\n     connection with our Services.\n     \n     \n     \n     This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy\n     Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (which includes our Cookie Policy\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy] and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and updates.\n     \n     \n     1.2 MEMBERS AND VISITORS\n     \n     When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register for our Services,\n     you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”\n     \n     \n     1.3 CHANGE\n     \n     \n     \n     We may make changes to the Contract.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to it,\n     we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes\n     before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may close your\n     account [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/63?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]. Your\n     continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are\n     consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.\n\n\n 2.  2. OBLIGATIONS\n     \n     \n     2.1 SERVICE ELIGIBILITY\n     \n     \n     \n     Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.\n     \n     To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\"(described below) or older; (2) you will only have one\n     LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the\n     Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of\n     others or persons under the age of 16.\n     \n     “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide\n     the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.\n     \n     \n     2.2 YOUR ACCOUNT\n     \n     \n     \n     You will keep your password a secret\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and keep it confidential; (2) not transfer any part of\n     your account (e.g., connections) and (3) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and Professional Community Policies\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/89880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]. You are\n     responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.\n     \n     As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by\n     another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right\n     to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal\n     account\n     \n     \n     2.3 PAYMENT\n     \n     \n     \n     You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there\n     may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Refunds are subject to our policy.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     If you buy any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional\n     terms [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/terms-for-paid-services] specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees\n     will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:\n     \n      * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).\n      * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions\n        in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.\n      * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period\n        for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. Learn how\n        to cancel or suspend\n        [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/50?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] your Premium\n        Services.\n      * All of your purchases of Services are subject to LinkedIn’s refund policy\n        [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5704?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en].\n      * We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.\n     \n     You can get a copy of your invoice through your LinkedIn account settings under “Purchase History\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/mnyfe/secure/purchasehistoryv4]”.\n     \n     \n     2.4 NOTICES AND MESSAGES\n     \n     \n     \n     You’re okay with us providing notices and messages to you through our websites, apps, and contact information. If your\n     contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the\n     contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact\n     information [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34987?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] up to\n     date.\n     \n     Please review your settings to control and limit\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] messages you receive\n     from us.\n     \n     \n     2.5 SHARING\n     \n     \n     \n     When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, articles, group posts, links to\n     news articles, job postings, messages and InMails. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other\n     Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services). Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices\n     you make about who can see content or information (e.g., message content to your addressees, sharing content only to LinkedIn\n     connections, restricting your profile visibility from search engines, or opting not to notify others of your LinkedIn profile\n     update). For job searching activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So, if you apply\n     for a job through our Service or opt to signal that you are interested in a job, our default is to share it only with the job\n     poster.\n     \n     We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it with or without notice.\n     \n     Key terms\n     \n     MINIMUM AGE\n     \n     Members who were below this new Minimum Age when they started using the Services under a previous User Agreement which had\n     allowed certain persons under 16 to use the Services, may continue to use the Services. As of June 2017 persons under the age\n     of 16 are not eligible to use our Services.\n\n\n 3.  3. RIGHTS AND LIMITS\n     \n     \n     3.1. YOUR LICENSE TO LINKEDIN\n     \n     \n     \n     You own all of the content, feedback and personal information you provide to us, but you also grant us a non-exclusive\n     license to it.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We’ll honor the choices you make about who gets to see your information and content, including how it can be used for ads.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     As between you and LinkedIn, you own the content and information that you submit or post to the Services, and you are only\n     granting LinkedIn and our affiliates the following non-exclusive license:\n     \n     A worldwide, transferable and sublicensable right to use, copy, modify, distribute, publish and process, information and\n     content that you provide through our Services and the services of others, without any further consent, notice and/or\n     compensation to you or others. These rights are limited in the following ways:\n     \n      1. You can end this license for specific content by deleting such content from the Services, or generally by closing your\n         account, except (a) to the extent you shared it with others as part of the Service and they copied, re-shared it or\n         stored it and (b) for the reasonable time it takes to remove from backup and other systems.\n      2. We will not include your content in advertisements for the products and services of third parties to others without your\n         separate consent (including sponsored content). However, we have the right, without payment to you or others, to serve\n         ads near your content and information, and your social actions may be visible and included with ads, as noted in the\n         Privacy Policy. If you use a Service feature, we may mention that with your name or photo to promote that feature within\n         our Services, subject to your settings.\n      3. We will get your consent if we want to give others the right to publish your content beyond the Services. However, if you\n         choose to share your post as \"public, everyone or similar\", we will enable a feature that allows other Members to embed\n         that public post onto third-party services, and we enable search engines to make that public content findable though\n         their services. Learn More\n         [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/86529?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en]\n      4. While we may edit and make format changes to your content (such as translating or transcribing it, modifying the size,\n         layout or file type or removing metadata), we will not modify the meaning of your expression.\n      5. Because you own your content and information and we only have non-exclusive rights to it, you may choose to make it\n         available to others, including under the terms of a Creative Commons license [https://creativecommons.org/choose/].\n     \n     \n     \n     You and LinkedIn agree that if content includes personal data, it is subject to our Privacy Policy.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You and LinkedIn agree that we may access, store, process and use any information and personal data that you provide in\n     accordance with, the terms of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] and your choices (including\n     settings).\n     \n     By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding our Services to LinkedIn, you agree that LinkedIn can use and share\n     (but does not have to) such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.\n     \n     \n     \n     You promise to only provide information and content that you have the right to share, and that your LinkedIn profile will be\n     truthful.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree to only provide content or information that does not violate the law nor anyone’s rights (including intellectual\n     property rights). You also agree that your profile information will be truthful. LinkedIn may be required by law to remove\n     certain information or content in certain countries.\n     \n     \n     3.2 SERVICE AVAILABILITY\n     \n     \n     \n     We may change or end any Service or modify our prices prospectively.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We may change, suspend or discontinue any of our Services. We may also modify our prices effective prospectively upon\n     reasonable notice to the extent allowed under the law.\n     \n     We don’t promise to store or keep showing any information and content that you’ve posted. LinkedIn is not a storage service.\n     You agree that we have no obligation to store, maintain or provide you a copy of any content or information that you or\n     others provide, except to the extent required by applicable law and as noted in our Privacy Policy.\n     \n     \n     3.3 OTHER CONTENT, SITES AND APPS\n     \n     \n     \n     Your use of others’ content and information posted on our Services, is at your own risk.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Others may offer their own products and services through our Services, and we aren’t responsible for those third-party\n     activities.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     By using the Services, you may encounter content or information that might be inaccurate, incomplete, delayed, misleading,\n     illegal, offensive or otherwise harmful. LinkedIn generally does not review content provided by our Members or others. You\n     agree that we are not responsible for others’ (including other Members’) content or information.

Members, Visitors and others\n       will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).\n     * In a group [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en], posts\n       are visible to others in the group. Your membership in groups is public and part of your profile, but you can change\n       visibility in your settings\n       [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/197?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en].\n     * Any information you share through companies’ or other organizations’ pages on our Services will be viewable by it and\n       others who visit those pages.\n     * When you follow a person or organization, you are visible to others and that “page owner” as a follower.\n     * We let senders know when you act on their message, subject to your settings\n       [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/71013?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] where\n       applicable.\n     * Subject to your settings\n       [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47992?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en], we let a Member\n       know when you view their profile.\n     * When you like or re-share or comment on another’s content (including ads), others will be able to view these “social\n       actions” and associate it with you (e.g., your name, profile and photo if you provided it).\n    \n    Your employer can see how you use Services they provided for your work (e.g. as a recruiter or sales agent) and related\n    information. We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\n    \n    ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTS\n    \n    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our\n    advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.\n    \n    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer\n    relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to\n    share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that\n    certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer\n    unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company\n    or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).\n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], when you use workplace tools and services (e.g.,\n    interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with\n    information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.\n    \n    \n    3.2 COMMUNICATION ARCHIVAL\n    \n    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n    \n    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media\n    activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those\n    Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our\n    Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.\n    \n    \n    3.3 OTHERS’ SERVICES\n    \n    \n    \n    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such\n    platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also\n    appear on the services of others.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], other services may look up your profile. When you opt\n    to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal\n    data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your\n    Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you\n    the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and\n    you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not. You may revoke\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/account] the link with such accounts.\n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-sharing], excerpts from your profile\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] will appear on the\n    services of others (e.g., search engine results, mail and calendar applications that show a user limited profile data of the\n    person they are meeting or messaging, social media aggregators\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/79854?trk=psettings-data-sharing_api&lang=en], talent and lead managers). “Old”\n    profile information remains on these services until they update their data cache with changes you made to your profile.\n    \n    \n    3.4 RELATED SERVICES\n    \n    We share your data across our different Services and LinkedIn affiliated entities.\n    \n    We will share your personal data with our affiliates to provide and develop our Services. We may combine information\n    internally across the different Services covered by this Privacy Policy to help our Services be more relevant and useful to\n    you and others. For example, we may personalize your feed or job recommendations based on your learning history.\n    \n    \n    3.5 SERVICE PROVIDERS\n    \n    We may use others to help us with our Services.\n    \n    We use others to help us provide our Services (e.g., maintenance, analysis, audit, payments, fraud detection, marketing and\n    development). They will have access to your information as reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are\n    obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.\n    \n    \n    3.6 LEGAL DISCLOSURES\n    \n    We may need to share your data when we believe it’s required by law or to help protect the rights and safety of you, us or\n    others.\n    \n    It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or\n    if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent or take action regarding\n    suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you; (3)\n    investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations; (4) protect the security or integrity of our\n    Services (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of\n    LinkedIn, our Members, personnel or others. We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when\n    appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such\n    demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not\n    promise to challenge every demand. To learn more see our Data Request Guidelines\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/16880?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] and Transparency\n    Report [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency].\n    \n    \n    3.7 CHANGE IN CONTROL OR SALE\n    \n    We may share your data when our business is sold to others, but it must continue to be used in accordance with this Privacy\n    Policy.\n    \n    We can also share your personal data as part of a sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these\n    events. Any other entity which buys us or part of our business will have the right to continue to use your data, but only in\n    the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.\n\n\n 5. 4. YOUR CHOICES & OBLIGATIONS\n    \n    \n    4.1 DATA RETENTION\n    \n    We keep most of your personal data for as long as your account is open.\n    \n    We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your account open or as needed to provide you Services. This\n    includes data you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your use of our Services. Even if you only use\n    our Services when looking for a new job every few years, we will retain your information and keep your profile open, unless\n    you close your account. In some cases we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services use) in a\n    depersonalized or aggregated form.\n    \n    \n    4.2 RIGHTS TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR PERSONAL DATA\n    \n    You can access or delete your personal data. You have many choices about how your data is collected, used and shared.\n    \n    We provide many choices\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/66?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] about the collection,\n    use and sharing of your data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/profile/edit] and controlling the visibility of your posts\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/431?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] to\n    advertising opt-outs\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/62931?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en] and communication\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/messages] controls.

This Cookie Policy applies to\nany LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies\nsuch as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as\npart of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (“Services”) and which\nincludes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with\nLinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information\nabout how and when we use these technologies. \n\nBy continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes\ndescribed in this policy.\n\n\nWHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED?\n\nENTER A SUMMARY\n\nType of technology Description Cookies\n\nA cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites\nmay receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third\nparties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521].\n\n \n\nWe use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is\nused for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our\nServices without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to\none of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the\ncurrent visit to a website or a browser session).\n\nPixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit\ninformation) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about\nyour interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us\nand third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store\ninformation locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling\nfeatures, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking\ntechnologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to\nsimilar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.\n\n\n\n\nOur cookie tables [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table] lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of\nour Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THESE TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR?\n\nBelow we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.\n\nENTER SUMMARY\n\nPurpose Description Authentication\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.\n\n \n\nIf you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line\nwith your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account.\n\n \n\nSecurity\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.\n\n \n\nFor example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious\nactivity and violations of our User Agreement.\n\n \n\nPreferences, features and services\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our\nServices more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use\nthese technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.\n\n \n\nFor example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local\nstorage to speed up site functionality.\n\n \n\nCustomized content\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.\n\n \n\nFor example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional\ninformation that relates to your previous search.\n\nPlugins on and off LinkedIn\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.\n\n \n\nFor example, our plugins, including the \"Apply with LinkedIn\" button or the \"Share\" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party\nsites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and\nrecognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking \"Apply\"), the plugin\nwill use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply.\n\n \n\nYou can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\n \n\nAdvertising\n\nCookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to\nmeasure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone\nwho was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another\nsite. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and\nhow it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.\n\n \n\nWe may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s\nor partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners.\n\n \n\nFor further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy\nPolicy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\n \n\nAs noted in Section 1.4 [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#collect] of our Privacy Policy, outside Designated\nCountries [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy], we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your\ndevice where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can\nprovide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.\n\n \n\nFor further information, please see Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\nAnalytics and research\n\nCookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.\n\n \n\nWe or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including\nas you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service\nproviders, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn\nwhether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.\n\n \n\nWe also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.\n\n \n\nIf you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with\nour Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may\nshare these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT THIRD PARTIES USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SERVICES?\n\nThird parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.\n\nFor example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for\ntheir own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit LinkedIn’s Help Center\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83251].\n\nThird parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use\ncookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to\nanalyze and research our Services.\n\n\nYOUR CHOICES\n\nYou have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to\nset cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you.\nIt may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.\n\n\nOPT OUT OF TARGETED ADVERTISING\n\nAs described in Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy], you have choices regarding the\npersonalized ads you may see.\n\nLinkedIn Members can adjust their settings here\n[https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy].\n\nVisitor controls can be found here\n[https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy].\n\nSome mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads\npersonalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile\nadvertising IDs for targeted advertising.\n\n\nBROWSER CONTROLS\n\nMost browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of\ncookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about\nbrowser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.\n\n\nWHAT IS DO NOT TRACK (DNT)?\n\nDNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet\nindustry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities\nacross websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.\n\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\nTo learn more about advertisers’ use of cookies, please visit the following links:\n\n * Internet Advertising Bureau (US) [https://www.iab.com/]\n * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU) [https://www.edaa.eu/]\n * Internet Advertising Bureau (EU) [https://iabeurope.eu/]\n\n * LinkedIn © 2024\n * About [https://about.linkedin.com?trk=content_footer-about]\n * Accessibility [https://www.linkedin.com/accessibility?trk=content_footer-accessibility]\n * User Agreement [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=content_footer-user-agreement]\n * Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy]\n * Cookie Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=content_footer-cookie-policy]\n * Copyright Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/copyright-policy?trk=content_footer-copyright-policy]\n * Brand Policy [https://brand.linkedin.com/policies?trk=content_footer-brand-policy]\n * Guest Controls [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls?trk=content_footer-guest-controls]\n * Community Guidelines [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=content_footer-community-guide]\n   \n *  * العربية (Arabic)\n    * Čeština (Czech)\n    * Dansk (Danish)\n    * Deutsch (German)\n    * English (English)\n    * Español (Spanish)\n    * Français (French)\n    * हिंदी (Hindi)\n    * Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\n    * Italiano (Italian)\n    * 日本語 (Japanese)\n    * 한국어 (Korean)\n    * Bahasa Malaysia (Malay)\n    * Nederlands (Dutch)\n    * Norsk (Norwegian)\n    * Polski (Polish)\n    * Português (Portuguese)\n    * Română (Romanian)\n    * Русский (Russian)\n    * Svenska (Swedish)\n    * ภาษาไทย (Thai)\n    * Tagalog (Tagalog)\n    * Türkçe (Turkish)\n    * Українська (Ukrainian)\n    * 简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified))\n    * 正體中文 (Chinese (Traditional))\n   \n   Language","metadata":{"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy","title":"Cookie Policy | LinkedIn","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"Skip to main content\nLinkedIn [/?trk=guest_ssr-login_request-otp-generation_nav-header-logo]\n\n\nSign in to LinkedIn with a one-time link\n\nEnter the verified email address registered with your LinkedIn account, and we’ll send you a link to sign in.\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\nNext Back [https://www.linkedin.com/login]\n\nCheck your email for a one-time link\n\nCheck your inbox for a one-time link at {:email}.

Your use of our Services is also subject to our Cookie Policy and\n     our Privacy Policy, which covers how we collect, use, share, and store your personal information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that by clicking “Join Now”, “Join LinkedIn”, “Sign Up” or similar, registering, accessing or using our services\n     (described below), you are agreeing to enter into a legally binding contract with LinkedIn (even if you are using our\n     Services on behalf of a company). If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not click “Join\n     Now” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this contract, at any time\n     you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.\n     \n     SERVICES\n     \n     This Contract applies to LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn-branded apps, LinkedIn Learning and other LinkedIn-related sites, apps,\n     communications and other services that state that they are offered under this Contract (“Services”), including the offsite\n     collection of data for those Services, such as our ads and the “Apply with LinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins.\n     Registered users of our Services are “Members” and unregistered users are “Visitors”.\n     \n     LINKEDIN\n     \n     You are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn (also referred to as “we” and “us”).\n     \n     We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and\n     Switzerland.\n     \n     If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company\n     (“LinkedIn Ireland”) and LinkedIn Ireland will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for,\n     or processed in connection with our Services.\n     \n     If you reside outside of the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn\n     Corp.”) and LinkedIn Corp. will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in\n     connection with our Services.\n     \n     \n     \n     This Contract applies to Members and Visitors.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to this Privacy\n     Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (which includes our Cookie Policy\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy] and other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and updates.\n     \n     \n     1.2 MEMBERS AND VISITORS\n     \n     When you register and join the LinkedIn Services, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register for our Services,\n     you may access certain features as a “Visitor.”\n     \n     \n     1.3 CHANGE\n     \n     \n     \n     We may make changes to the Contract.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to it,\n     we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes\n     before they become effective.

OBLIGATIONS\n     \n     \n     2.1 SERVICE ELIGIBILITY\n     \n     \n     \n     Here are some promises that you make to us in this Contract:\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You’re eligible to enter into this Contract and you are at least our “Minimum Age.”\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.\n     \n     To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the \"Minimum Age\"(described below) or older; (2) you will only have one\n     LinkedIn account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by LinkedIn from using the\n     Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of\n     others or persons under the age of 16.\n     \n     “Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for LinkedIn to lawfully provide\n     the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.\n     \n     \n     2.2 YOUR ACCOUNT\n     \n     \n     \n     You will keep your password a secret\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You will not share an account with anyone else and will follow our rules and the law.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Members are account holders.

You are\n     responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.\n     \n     As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by\n     another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right\n     to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal\n     account\n     \n     \n     2.3 PAYMENT\n     \n     \n     \n     You’ll honor your payment obligations and you are okay with us storing your payment information. You understand that there\n     may be fees and taxes that are added to our prices.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Refunds are subject to our policy.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     If you buy any of our paid Services (“Premium Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional\n     terms [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/pop/terms-for-paid-services] specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees\n     will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:\n     \n      * Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).\n      * We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions\n        in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.\n      * If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period\n        for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date.

If your\n     contact information is out of date, you may miss out on important notices.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the\n     contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact\n     information [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34987?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] up to\n     date.\n     \n     Please review your settings to control and limit\n     [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/67?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_user-agreement&lang=en] messages you receive\n     from us.\n     \n     \n     2.5 SHARING\n     \n     \n     \n     When you share information on our Services, others can see, copy and use that information.\n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, articles, group posts, links to\n     news articles, job postings, messages and InMails. Information and content that you share or post may be seen by other\n     Members, Visitors or others (including off of the Services).

If you take a social\n    action (such as like, comment or share) on these ads, your action is associated with your name and viewable by others,\n    including the advertiser. Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/data-visibility], if you take a social\n    action on the LinkedIn Services, that action may be mentioned with related ads.

This\n    does not opt you out of receiving advertising; you will continue to get other ads by advertisers not listed with these self\n    regulatory tools. You can also opt-out [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/enhanced-advertising] specifically from our uses of\n    certain categories of data to show you more relevant ads.

However, if you view or click on\n    an ad on or off our Services, the ad provider will get a signal that someone visited the page that displayed the ad, and they\n    may, through the use of mechanisms such as cookies, determine it is you. Advertising partners can associate personal data\n    collected by the advertiser directly from you with hashed IDs or device identifiers received from us. In such instances, we\n    seek to contractually require such advertising partners to obtain your explicit, opt-in consent before doing so.\n    \n    \n    2.5 MARKETING\n    \n    We promote our Services to you and others.\n    \n    In addition to advertising our Services, we use Members’ data and content for invitations and communications promoting\n    membership and network growth, engagement and our Services, such as by showing your connections that you have used a feature\n    on our Services.\n    \n    \n    2.6 DEVELOPING SERVICES AND RESEARCH\n    \n    We develop our Services and conduct research\n    \n    SERVICE DEVELOPMENT\n    \n    We use data, including public feedback, to conduct research\n    [https://engineering.linkedin.com/ab-testing/xlnt-platform-driving-ab-testing-linkedin] and development for our Services in\n    order to provide you and others with a better, more intuitive and personalized experience, drive membership growth and\n    engagement on our Services, and help connect professionals to each other and to economic opportunity.\n    \n    OTHER RESEARCH\n    \n    We seek to create economic opportunity for Members of the global workforce and to help them be more productive and successful.\n    We use the personal data available to us to research social, economic and workplace trends, such as jobs availability and\n    skills needed for these jobs [https://blog.linkedin.com/2017/february/3/introducing-the-linkedin-workforce-report] and\n    policies that help bridge the gap in various industries and geographic areas.

Subject to your settings\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], it can also be visible to others on or off of our Services (e.g., Visitors to\n    our Services or users of third- party search engines). As detailed in our Help Center\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/77?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en], your settings, degree\n    of connection with the viewing Member, the subscriptions they may have, their usage of our Services\n    [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/52950?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en], access channels\n    and search types (e.g., by name or by keyword) impact the availability of your profile and whether they can view certain\n    fields in your profile.\n    \n    POSTS, LIKES, FOLLOWS, COMMENTS, MESSAGES\n    \n    Our Services allow viewing and sharing information including through posts, likes, follows and comments.\n    \n     * When you share an article or a post (e.g., an update, image, video or article) publicly it can be viewed by everyone and\n       re-shared anywhere (subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy]). Members, Visitors and others\n       will be able to find and see your publicly-shared content, including your name (and photo if you have provided one).\n     * In a group [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/1164?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_privacy-policy&lang=en], posts\n       are visible to others in the group.

We will not show them your job searches or personal messages.\n    \n    ENTERPRISE ACCOUNTS\n    \n    Your employer may offer you access to our enterprise Services such as Recruiter, Sales Navigator, LinkedIn Learning or our\n    advertising Campaign Manager. Your employer can review and manage your use of such enterprise Services.\n    \n    Depending on the enterprise Service, before you use such Service, we will ask for permission to share with your employer\n    relevant data from your profile or use of our non-enterprise Services. For example, users of Sales Navigator will be asked to\n    share their “social selling index”, a score calculated in part based on their personal account activity. We understand that\n    certain activities such as job hunting and personal messages are sensitive, and so we do not share those with your employer\n    unless you choose to share it with them through our Services (for example, by applying for a new position in the same company\n    or mentioning your job hunting in a message to a co-worker through our Services).\n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], when you use workplace tools and services (e.g.,\n    interactive employee directory tools) certain of your data may also be made available to your employer or be connected with\n    information we receive from your employer to enable these tools and services.\n    \n    \n    3.2 COMMUNICATION ARCHIVAL\n    \n    Regulated Members may need to store communications outside of our Service.\n    \n    Some Members (or their employers) need, for legal or professional compliance, to archive their communications and social media\n    activity, and will use services of others to provide these archival services. We enable archiving of messages by and to those\n    Members outside of our Services. For example, a financial advisor needs to archive communications with her clients through our\n    Services in order to maintain her professional financial advisor license.\n    \n    \n    3.3 OTHERS’ SERVICES\n    \n    \n    \n    You may link your account with others’ services so that they can look up your contacts’ profiles, post your shares on such\n    platforms, or enable you to start conversations with your connections on such platforms. Excerpts from your profile will also\n    appear on the services of others.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    Subject to your settings [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/privacy], other services may look up your profile. When you opt\n    to link your account with other services, personal data will become available to them. The sharing and use of that personal\n    data will be described in, or linked to, a consent screen when you opt to link the accounts. For example, you may link your\n    Twitter or WeChat account to share content from our Services into these other services, or your email provider may give you\n    the option to upload your LinkedIn contacts into its own service. Third-party services have their own privacy policies, and\n    you may be giving them permission to use your data in ways we would not.

We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their personal data when\n    appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such\n    demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not\n    promise to challenge every demand.

This Cookie Policy applies to\nany LinkedIn product or service that links to this policy or incorporates it by reference. We use cookies and similar technologies\nsuch as pixels, local storage and mobile ad IDs (collectively referred to in this policy as “cookies”) to collect and use data as\npart of our Services, as defined in our Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy] (“Services”) and which\nincludes our sites, communications, mobile applications and off-site Services, such as our ad services and the “Apply with\nLinkedIn” and “Share with LinkedIn” plugins or tags. In the spirit of transparency, this policy provides detailed information\nabout how and when we use these technologies. \n\nBy continuing to visit or use our Services, you are agreeing to the use of cookies and similar technologies for the purposes\ndescribed in this policy.\n\n\nWHAT TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED?\n\nENTER A SUMMARY\n\nType of technology Description Cookies\n\nA cookie is a small file placed onto your device that enables LinkedIn features and functionality. Any browser visiting our sites\nmay receive cookies from us or cookies from third parties such as our customers, partners or service providers. We or third\nparties may also place cookies in your browser when you visit non-LinkedIn sites that display ads or that host our plugins or tags\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/65521].\n\n \n\nWe use two types of cookies: persistent cookies and session cookies. A persistent cookie lasts beyond the current session and is\nused for many purposes, such as recognizing you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to LinkedIn and interact with our\nServices without signing in again. Since a persistent cookie stays in your browser, it will be read by LinkedIn when you return to\none of our sites or visit a third party site that uses our Services. Session cookies last only as long as the session (usually the\ncurrent visit to a website or a browser session).\n\nPixels A pixel is a tiny image that may be embedded within web pages and emails, requiring a call (which provides device and visit\ninformation) to our servers in order for the pixel to be rendered in those web pages and emails. We use pixels to learn more about\nyour interactions with email content or web content, such as whether you interacted with ads or posts. Pixels can also enable us\nand third parties to place cookies on your browser. Local storage Local storage enables a website or application to store\ninformation locally on your device(s). Local storage may be used to improve the LinkedIn experience, for example, by enabling\nfeatures, remembering your preferences and speeding up site functionality. Other similar technologies We also use other tracking\ntechnologies, such as mobile advertising IDs and tags for similar purposes as described in this Cookie Policy. References to\nsimilar technologies in this policy includes pixels, local storage, and other tracking technologies.\n\n\n\n\nOur cookie tables [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/l/cookie-table] lists cookies and similar technologies that are used as part of\nour Services. Please note that the names of cookies and similar technologies may change over time.\n\n\nWHAT ARE THESE TECHNOLOGIES USED FOR?\n\nBelow we describe the purposes for which we use these technologies.\n\nENTER SUMMARY\n\nPurpose Description Authentication\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our Services.\n\n \n\nIf you’re signed into LinkedIn, these technologies help us show you the right information and personalize your experience in line\nwith your settings. For example, cookies enable LinkedIn to identify you and verify your account.\n\n \n\nSecurity\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to make your interactions with our Services faster and more secure.\n\n \n\nFor example, we use cookies to enable and support our security features, keep your account safe and to help us detect malicious\nactivity and violations of our User Agreement.\n\n \n\nPreferences, features and services\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to enable the functionality of our Services, such as helping you to fill out forms on our\nServices more easily and providing you with features, insights and customized content in conjunction with our plugins. We also use\nthese technologies to remember information about your browser and your preferences.\n\n \n\nFor example, cookies can tell us which language you prefer and what your communications preferences are. We may also use local\nstorage to speed up site functionality.\n\n \n\nCustomized content\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to customize your experience on our Services.\n\n \n\nFor example, we may use cookies to remember previous searches so that when you return to our services, we can offer additional\ninformation that relates to your previous search.\n\nPlugins on and off LinkedIn\n\nWe use cookies and similar technologies to enable LinkedIn plugins both on and off the LinkedIn sites.\n\n \n\nFor example, our plugins, including the \"Apply with LinkedIn\" button or the \"Share\" button may be found on LinkedIn or third-party\nsites, such as the sites of our customers and partners. Our plugins use cookies and other technologies to provide analytics and\nrecognize you on LinkedIn and third-party sites. If you interact with a plugin (for instance, by clicking \"Apply\"), the plugin\nwill use cookies to identify you and initiate your request to apply.\n\n \n\nYou can learn more about plugins in our Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\n \n\nAdvertising\n\nCookies and similar technologies help us show relevant advertising to you more effectively, both on and off our Services and to\nmeasure the performance of such ads. We use these technologies to learn whether content has been shown to you or whether someone\nwho was presented with an ad later came back and took an action (e.g., downloaded a white paper or made a purchase) on another\nsite. Similarly, our partners or service providers may use these technologies to determine whether we've shown an ad or a post and\nhow it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with ads.\n\n \n\nWe may also work with our customers and partners to show you an ad on or off LinkedIn, such as after you’ve visited a customer’s\nor partner’s site or application. These technologies help us provide aggregated information to our customers and partners.\n\n \n\nFor further information regarding the use of cookies for advertising purposes, please see Sections 1.4 and 2.4 of the Privacy\nPolicy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\n \n\nAs noted in Section 1.4 [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy#collect] of our Privacy Policy, outside Designated\nCountries [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy], we also collect (or rely on others who collect) information about your\ndevice where you have not engaged with our Services (e.g., ad ID, IP address, operating system and browser information) so we can\nprovide our Members with relevant ads and better understand their effectiveness.\n\n \n\nFor further information, please see Section 1.4 of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy].\n\nAnalytics and research\n\nCookies and similar technologies help us learn more about how well our Services and plugins perform in different locations.\n\n \n\nWe or our service providers use these technologies to understand, improve, and research products, features and services, including\nas you navigate through our sites or when you access LinkedIn from other sites, applications or devices. We or our service\nproviders, use these technologies to determine and measure the performance of ads or posts on and off LinkedIn and to learn\nwhether you have interacted with our websites, content or emails and provide analytics based on those interactions.\n\n \n\nWe also use these technologies to provide aggregated information to our customers and partners as part of our Services.\n\n \n\nIf you are a LinkedIn member but logged out of your account on a browser, LinkedIn may still continue to log your interaction with\nour Services on that browser until the expiration of the cookie in order to generate usage analytics for our Services. We may\nshare these analytics in aggregate form with our customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT THIRD PARTIES USE THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SERVICES?\n\nThird parties such as our customers, partners and service providers may use cookies in connection with our Services.\n\nFor example, third parties may use cookies in their LinkedIn pages, job posts and their advertisements on and off LinkedIn for\ntheir own marketing purposes. For an illustration, please visit LinkedIn’s Help Center\n[https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/83251].\n\nThird parties may also use cookies in connection with our off-site Services, such as LinkedIn ad services. Third parties may use\ncookies to help us to provide our Services. We may also work with third parties for our own marketing purposes and to enable us to\nanalyze and research our Services.\n\n\nYOUR CHOICES\n\nYou have choices on how LinkedIn uses cookies and similar technologies. Please note that if you limit the ability of LinkedIn to\nset cookies and similar technologies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it may no longer be personalized to you.\nIt may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information.\n\n\nOPT OUT OF TARGETED ADVERTISING\n\nAs described in Section 2.4 of the Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy], you have choices regarding the\npersonalized ads you may see.\n\nLinkedIn Members can adjust their settings here\n[https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/advertising?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy].\n\nVisitor controls can be found here\n[https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out?trk=microsites-frontend_legal_cookie-policy].\n\nSome mobile device operating systems such as Android provide the ability to control the use of mobile advertising IDs for ads\npersonalization. You can learn how to use these controls by visiting the manufacturer’s website. We do not use iOS mobile\nadvertising IDs for targeted advertising.\n\n\nBROWSER CONTROLS\n\nMost browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings, which may be adapted to reflect your consent to the use of\ncookies. Further, most browsers also enable you to review and erase cookies, including LinkedIn cookies. To learn more about\nbrowser controls, please consult the documentation that your browser manufacturer provides.\n\n\nWHAT IS DO NOT TRACK (DNT)?\n\nDNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet\nindustry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities\nacross websites by using browser settings. As such, LinkedIn does not generally respond to “do not track” signals.\n\n\nOTHER HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\nTo learn more about advertisers’ use of cookies, please visit the following links:\n\n * Internet Advertising Bureau (US) [https://www.iab.com/]\n * European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EU) [https://www.edaa.eu/]\n * Internet Advertising Bureau (EU) [https://iabeurope.eu/]\n\n * LinkedIn © 2024\n * About [https://about.linkedin.com?trk=content_footer-about]\n * Accessibility [https://www.linkedin.com/accessibility?trk=content_footer-accessibility]\n * User Agreement [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement?trk=content_footer-user-agreement]\n * Privacy Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=content_footer-privacy-policy]\n * Cookie Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=content_footer-cookie-policy]\n * Copyright Policy [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/copyright-policy?trk=content_footer-copyright-policy]\n * Brand Policy [https://brand.linkedin.com/policies?trk=content_footer-brand-policy]\n * Guest Controls [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls?trk=content_footer-guest-controls]\n * Community Guidelines [https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/34593?trk=content_footer-community-guide]\n   \n *  * العربية (Arabic)\n    * Čeština (Czech)\n    * Dansk (Danish)\n    * Deutsch (German)\n    * English (English)\n    * Español (Spanish)\n    * Français (French)\n    * हिंदी (Hindi)\n    * Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)\n    * Italiano (Italian)\n    * 日本語 (Japanese)\n    * 한국어 (Korean)\n    * Bahasa Malaysia (Malay)\n    * Nederlands (Dutch)\n    * Norsk (Norwegian)\n    * Polski (Polish)\n    * Português (Portuguese)\n    * Română (Romanian)\n    * Русский (Russian)\n    * Svenska (Swedish)\n    * ภาษาไทย (Thai)\n    * Tagalog (Tagalog)\n    * Türkçe (Turkish)\n    * Українська (Ukrainian)\n    * 简体中文 (Chinese (Simplified))\n    * 正體中文 (Chinese (Traditional))\n   \n   Language","metadata":{"source":"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy?trk=d_checkpoint_lg_consumerLogin_ft_cookie_policy","title":"Cookie Policy | LinkedIn","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"Skip to main content\nLinkedIn Logo [https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/6zm111mce7vohqze950ilreo4] LinkedIn Logo\n[https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/5g0hjlcng3j5pgn50n2et1ca2]\n * User Agreement [https://linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement]\n    * Summary of User Agreement [https://linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement-summary]\n\n * Privacy Policy [https://linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy]\n * Professional Community Policies [https://linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies]\n * Cookie Policy [https://linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy]\n * Copyright Policy [https://linkedin.com/legal/copyright-policy]\n * California Privacy Disclosure [https://linkedin.com/legal/california-privacy-disclosure]\n\n * User Agreement [https://linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement]\n   * Summary of User Agreement [https://linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement-summary]\n * Privacy Policy [https://linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy]\n * Professional Community Policies [https://linkedin.com/legal/professional-community-policies]\n * Cookie Policy [https://linkedin.com/legal/cookie-policy]\n * Copyright Policy [https://linkedin.com/legal/copyright-policy]\n * California Privacy Disclosure [https://linkedin.com/legal/california-privacy-disclosure]\n\n\n[https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D08AQEitUx13jmkVA/croft-frontend-shrinkToFit1024/0/1604518222344?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=ybyElGKs5wwGF3CvXXlWjqbWBXKm_7PMwrp8HUTlLpA]\n\n\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\n\n\n\n\nEffective March 26, 2014\n\n\nCOMPLAINTS REGARDING CONTENT POSTED ON THE LINKEDIN WEBSITE\n\nLinkedIn respects the intellectual property rights of others and desires to offer a platform which contains no content that\nviolates those rights.

It is also our policy, in appropriate circumstances and in our discretion, to disable and/or terminate\nthe accounts of Members, or groups as the case may be, who infringe or repeatedly infringe the rights of others or otherwise post\nunlawful content.\n\nPlease note that any notice or counter-notice you submit must be truthful and must be submitted under penalty of perjury.
